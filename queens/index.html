				<p id="intro">Scheherazade is one of my heroes. Queen Scheherazade is a character in the back story behind One Thousand and One Nights, also known as the Arabian Nights, a collection of folk tales. Here is my version of her amazing story of cunning and courage :)</p>

			<div id="story">
				<p>There once lived a King Shahryar, Persian Sassanid King of kings. One day he walks in on his young wife cheating on him, so out of vengeance, he executes her. He, however, remains very resentful, so he decides to take his bitterness out on all women. He orders his vizier, Jafar, to search the lands and bring him one virgin girl to marry each day, with whom he would marry by that night and execute the following morning so that she would be unable to betray him. The vizier carries out his job diligently, but after a few years, starts to run out of virgins for the king, until he is left with only his family, starting with his daughter, Scheherazade. She is brave so she urges her father to be loyal and volunteer her, which he ultimately does.</p>

				<p>Scheherazade marries the king as scheduled, and later on the night of their wedding day, she tells the king she is aware that she will be executed. She asks the king kindly for one favor: to tell her young sister a bedtime story one last time. The king reluctantly agrees and lets her tell the story as the king listens in. Scheherazade tells her sister a riveting tale, and after many hours, she tells her that she will finish the story the next day.</p>

				<p>"Finish the story," says the king.</p>

				<p>"It is late, for the sun is starting to rise, I will continue the story the next night," says Scheherazade.</p>

				<p>The king, with his mind wrapped around the cliffhanger and curious to hear the rest of the story, decides to spare Scheherazade her life for one day to hear it. The next night, she continues, through the night, and ends on another cliffhanger by sunrise. She insists on finishing her story the next night. Again, the king grants her immunity for another night to hear the ending.</p> 

				<p>This continues for many nights, where the king spares Scheherazade her life in order to let her continue her story, which Scheherazade continues to end on cliffhangers, leaving the king to want more. She never ends her story. After 1001 nights, the king tells Scheherazade, "I have fallen in love with you and your stories, and I will no longer plan to execute you. As long as you stay with me and share your stories, I will forever be a happy man." As so, Scheherazade ends the plight of executing women and cures the king of his spite. The royal couple remain together and live happily ever after.</p>
